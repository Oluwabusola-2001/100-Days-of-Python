Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables

Notes from Day 1

Printing
To print, you use the print() function. You have to run this code for it to show. 
print() is used to display your input (or any message, variable, or result) as output in the console.

Commenting
# is use to make a comment so you can actaully understand why you used a code later in the future. ctrl +1 is used on spyder to make comments. find out for your preferred IDE
A string is put into a bracket and must be used with quotation marks to make sense. example ("Happy")
""" 3 quotation marks at the start and at the end can also be used for commenting to explain long line of codes.

Debugging
Debugging is simpy removing bugs i.e errors in your cide. 
If you get an error message, always go to google first to check what could be wrong.

String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the + sign. to add two strings together. YOu can also add space to amke it readble in different forms, either before closing the first quotation
or before starting to type after the quotation for the second string or just space with its own string. Example below
("Hello " + "World") or ("Hello" + " World") or " "

Variables
A variable in Python is a container for storing data. Its like labelling something
You can assign a value to a variable using the = sign Example is username = James
Note: No space. username/ user_name is right. user name is wrong
Do not start with numbers. 1boy is wrong. boy1 is correct
You dont have to use functions like input or print to assign variables.

Calcaulating the length
You can calculate the length of characters using the len() function example
length = len(username)

solving it will since we know username = James
length = 5


#Task

print("Mix 500g of Flour, 10g of Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.") #using theprint statement
print("Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
print("Add 3g of Salt.")
print("Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
print("Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")
print("Hello World!\nHello World!") #forward slash and n to break codes into different line
print("Hello"+"World")
print("Hello "+" World")

input("What is your name?")

print("Hello " +input("What is your name?")) 
print("Hello" " " +input("What is your name?") + "!")

# print(len(input("What is your name?")))
username =input("what is your name?")
length = len(username)
print(length)

glass1=("milk")
glass=("juice")

glass1=("juice")
print(glass1)


#The end of Day1
name = "chimaroke"
print(len(name))
