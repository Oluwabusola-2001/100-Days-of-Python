Day 2 - Data types, Numbers, Operations, Type Conversion, Fstrings

Data types. 

We have different data types in python

1. String: characters in a quotation
example is "Hello"
To pull out a character from a string, you use [] sqaure brackets example below
print("Hello"[0]) #it is called subscripting 

THINGS TO NOTE 
You satart counting the first letter as 0.
Space is also a character
you can also use negative number ( -1 -2) and count from the back

Task 
Pull out letter "o"
print("Hello"[4])
example below 
print("Hello"[-1])

Integer - Whole number without decimal. No need for quotation marks
if you print this ("123" + "345"). It will just concatuenate because you used strings
You dont need to put strings for integer 
Example below
print(123 + 456) THIS WILL GIVE 579
Large intgers can be represented with underscore and the coMputer will recognize it
print(342_245_789)

Floats means floating number i.e decimal point
print(3.42)

Boolean means only two values True/False 
THINGS TO NOTE
No quotation, always start with capital letter
Examle print(True)

Type Error, Type Cheking and Type Conversion

Type Error occurs when you use wrong data type
Check this example
Len(12345) 
Len() doesnt work with integer and will give you a type error. you have to change to string

Data type Chceking

You can check the data type of any value or variable using the type() function
EXAMPLES 
print(type("Hello")) #It gave us a class str which means string
print(type(123)) #it gives an integer
print(type("123")) #Note that it gives us a string because it is in quotations
print(type(False)) #it gives boolean
print(type(234.90)) #it gives float

Data type conversion

This is to convert a piece of data into a different data type. 
Example
int("123") #converting the string to integer it gives 123
# you can not convert alphabets to integer
int()
float()
bool()
str()

#Task
# Make this line of code run without errors
print("Number of letters in your name: " + len(input("Enter your name")))
It gives a TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str (This was the error gotten)

# solution
username = input("Enter your name")
length = len(username)
print("Number of letters in your name: " + str(length))

Mathematical Operations

There are different types

1. ADDITION USES THE + SIGN
Example 9+2 gives us 11

2. SUBTRACTION USES THE - SIGN
Example 5-2 gives us 3

3. MULTIPLICATION USES THE ASTERICK * SIGN
Example 6*6 gives us 36

4. DIVISION USES THE FORWARD SLASH / SIGN
Example 8/4 gives us 2.0
Note: Divison always gives us a float as answer 
But if you do not want your answer in float type, you can use DOUBLE FORWARD SLASH // and it will give you the answer as an integer but you have to be careful.
This is because it is hiding the remaining floats. So you have to be sure that it is divisible.

5. EXPONENT/ RAISE A NUMBER TO THE POWER USES THE DOUBLE ASTERICK SIGN
Example 2**3 gives us 8

SAME MATHEMATICAL OPERATION ON THE SAME LINE OF CODE. WHAT DO YOU DO?
SET PRIOROTY USING PEMDAS- Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction. 
Prioritise left to right if you see division and multiplication togther or addition and subtraction together.

Example
(3*3+3/3-3) if you print it, it gives 7

TASK
Use that calculation to ensure your output is 3
solution 1 - (3/3*3+3-3)
solution 2 - (3*(3+3)/3-3)

TASK 
BMI Calculator
The body mass index (BMI) is a measure used in medicine to see if someone is underweight or overweight. This is the formula used to calculate it:
bmi is equal to the person's weight divided by the person's height squared.
Convert this sentence into code.
SOLUTION
weight=float(input("Enter your weight")) #CHANGING THE INTENDED STRING TO FLOAT SINCE WE AR GOING TO TYPE IN FLOAT
height=float(input("Enter your height")) 
bmi=(weight/(height*2))
print(bmi) 

NUMBER MANIPULATION

Flooring a Number
You can floor a number or remove all decimal places using the int() function. This converts a float to an integer
Using the above example 
print(bmi) - print(int(bmi)

Rounding up a Number
You can round up or down using the round() function
round(bmi) round up or down based on the number
Example 
print(round(bmi)

Can also round to decimal places
print(round(bmi, 2) #gives answer in 2 decimal places


Assignment Operator
+= -= *= /=
These adds the number on the right to the number originla value of variable on the left and assigns the new value to the variable.
Example
Score  = 0
#user scores a point
score += 1
print(score)

F strings
F strings is used to insert a variable or am expression into a string.
Check this example
age=12
print(" I am age years old)
it will give error.
To insert a variable, you use f and then the variable in curly bracket.
Example.
age = 12
print(f"I am {age} years old") #It prints out I am 12 years old

Example
score = 0
height= 1.8
is_winning= True
print(f"Your score is = {score}, your height is {height} and you are winning is {is_winning} ") #It prints out Your score is 0, your height is 1.8 and youre are winning uis true.
