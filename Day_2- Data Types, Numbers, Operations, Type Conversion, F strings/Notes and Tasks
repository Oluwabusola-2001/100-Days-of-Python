Day 2 - Data types, Numbers, Operations, Type Conversion, Fstrings

Data types. 

We have different data types in python

1. String: characters in a quotation
example is "Hello"
To pull out a character from a string, you use [] sqaure brackets example below
print("Hello"[0]) #it is called subscripting 

THINGS TO NOTE 
You satart counting the first letter as 0.
Space is also a character
you can also use negative number ( -1 -2) and count from the back

Task 
Pull out letter "o"
print("Hello"[4])
example below 
print("Hello"[-1])

Integer - Whole number without decimal. No need for quotation marks
if you print this ("123" + "345"). It will just concatuenate because you used strings
You dont need to put strings for integer 
Example below
print(123 + 456) THIS WILL GIVE 579
Large intgers can be represented with underscore and the coMputer will recognize it
print(342_245_789)

Floats means floating number i.e decimal point
print(3.42)

Boolean means only two values True/False 
THINGS TO NOTE
No quotation, always start with capital letter
Examle print(True)

Type Error, Type Cheking and Type Conversion

Type Error occurs when you use wrong data type
Check this example
Len(12345) 
Len() doesnt work with integer and will give you a type error. you have to change to string

Data type Chceking

You can check the data type of any value or variable using the type() function
EXAMPLES 
print(type("Hello")) #It gave us a class str which means string
print(type(123)) #it gives an integer
print(type("123")) #Note that it gives us a string because it is in quotations
print(type(False)) #it gives boolean
print(type(234.90)) #it gives float

Data type conversion

This is to convert a piece of data into a different data type. 
Example
int("123") #converting the string to integer it gives 123
# you can not convert alphabets to integer
int()
float()
bool()
str()

#Task
# Make this line of code run without errors
print("Number of letters in your name: " + len(input("Enter your name")))
It gives a TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str (This was the error gotten)

# solution
print("Number of letters in your name:  " len
input(int("Enter your name"))
